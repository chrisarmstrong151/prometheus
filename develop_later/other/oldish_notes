Instantaneous transition between unspliced and spliced

Long-term modeling difficult due to differing turnover rates in protein products; typical applications have used cells measured on relatively short time intervals (<24 hrs)

No incorporation of feedback networks in gene expression

Poor standards for incorporation of orthogonal data which may confound signal (m6A, PTMs, etc…)

Lack of consistentency in terminology to describe different phenotypic states

Lack of consistency in clustering rules across different RNA velocity engines

gene set enrichment analysis doesn't necessarily give precise interpretation





----------------
differences between models
 - We infer the gene-specific reaction rates of transcription, splicing and degradation and an underlying gene-shared latent time in an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) framework. The inferred latent time represents the cell’s internal clock, which accurately describes the cell’s position in the underlying biological process. In contrast to existing similarity-based pseudo-time methods, this latent time is grounded only on transcriptional dynamics and accounts for speed and direction of motion.
 - steady state assumes constant splicing rate across all genes
 - dynamic assumes individual genes have their own transcript, splicing, and degradation
