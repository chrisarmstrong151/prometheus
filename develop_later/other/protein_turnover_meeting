44 different cell lies
paul ziloc approach, heavy isotopically labeled amino acids
assume steady state conditions
average 6-8000 proteins/cell line
in the end, 15,000 proteins
mouse data

for most clients, access to different proteins across cell lines
5-10,000 dollar/protein

10,000 dollar/cell line

collection of txt files in the end

no primary cell line data

low expression explains and/or extremely short and long-lived half lives explains

once reach contact inhibition, dont have steady state anymore

measurement time up 10 days

may be able to sell us non-measureable sets


know what the expect from measurements, know ground-truth data out there

look for academic collaborator to generate proteomic data for us

these guys developed
rapidfire mass spec
covalent binding
